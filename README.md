# FileSortingProject
Created a Basic File Sorting software using the Go programing Language 
In order to use the code do the following: 
 1. Import the repository into Replit 
 2. In the Peach Folder delete the peach.txt file 
 3. In the test folder delete the testC.txt file 
 4. Run the Main.Go file 
When ran the program will write three files in the main directory, it will then autosort those files in the correct folder according to there name
